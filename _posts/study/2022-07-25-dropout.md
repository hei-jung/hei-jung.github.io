Dropout이란 뭔지 알아보자.<br>

## Dropout

PyTorch 공식 문서에서는 이렇게 말하고 있다.

During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with probability p using samples from a Bernoulli distribution. Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call.

This has proven to be an effective technique for regularization and preventing the co-adaptation of neurons as described in the paper Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors .

Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of $\frac{1}{1-p}$ ​during training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an identity function.
